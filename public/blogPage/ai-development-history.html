            <div class="article-meta">August 20, 2025</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI), as a cutting-edge technological field that emerged in the mid-20th century, has profoundly changed all aspects of human society. This article will systematically review the development history of AI, from early theoretical foundations to modern deep learning revolution, comprehensively presenting the evolutionary trajectory, key technological breakthroughs, and future development trends of this field. The article will combine historical images and authoritative materials to show readers the complete journey of AI from laboratory to real world.</p>
            
            <h2>I. Germination and Foundation: Theoretical Origins of AI (1940s-1950s)</h2>
            
            <p>The ideological roots of artificial intelligence can be traced back to the thoughts of ancient philosophers, but as a modern science, its formal birth dates back to the mid-20th century. Key breakthroughs during this period laid the theoretical foundation and technical prototype for AI.</p>
            
            <h3>1. Theoretical Pioneers and Early Conceptions</h3>
            
            <p>British mathematician Alan Turing proposed the famous "Turing Test" in his 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" - if a machine can engage in conversation with humans without being distinguished, then it can be considered intelligent. This thought experiment established the first operational definition for AI research.</p>
            
            <p>Meanwhile, American neuroscientist Warren McCulloch and logician Walter Pitts proposed the first mathematical model of neurons in 1943, demonstrating the possibility of neural networks performing simple logical operations, which is considered the beginning of artificial neural networks.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Dartmouth Conference: The Formal Birth of AI</h3>
            
            <p>In the summer of 1956, scientists including John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and Claude Shannon held a two-month workshop at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. It was at this conference that the term "Artificial Intelligence" was first formally proposed, marking the birth of AI as an independent research field.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>The conference proposal stated: "The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it." This optimistic spirit would dominate the first golden period of AI research.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>II. Golden Age and First AI Winter (1956-1974)</h2>
            
            <p>In the decade following the Dartmouth Conference, AI research experienced its first period of vigorous development, but soon encountered practical challenges.</p>
            
            <h3>1. Early Achievements and Over-optimism</h3>
            
            <p>Major achievements during this period included:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Logic Theorist (1956)</strong>: A program developed by Allen Newell and Herbert Simon that could automatically prove mathematical theorems, even finding new proof methods for some theorems in "Principia Mathematica".</li>
                <li><strong>General Problem Solver (1957)</strong>: Attempted to simulate general human problem-solving methods.</li>
                <li><strong>ELIZA (1966)</strong>: An early chatbot developed by Joseph Weizenbaum that could simulate psychotherapist conversations.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These early successes made researchers overly optimistic. Herbert Simon predicted in 1965: "Machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work that a man can do." Marvin Minsky claimed in 1967: "Within a generation... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will be substantially solved."</p>
            
            <h3>2. Technical Bottlenecks and First AI Winter</h3>
            
            <p>However, as research deepened, AI encountered insurmountable obstacles:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Insufficient computing power: The memory and speed of computers at that time were far from meeting the needs of complex AI tasks</li>
                <li>Knowledge representation problem: Machines lacked common sense and world knowledge</li>
                <li>Combinatorial explosion: The possible solution space for complex problems grew exponentially with problem size</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>In 1969, Minsky and Seymour Papert proved the limitations of simple neural networks (such as inability to solve XOR problems) in their book "Perceptrons", which directly led to neural network research falling into a decade-long trough, known as the "First AI Winter".</p>
            
            <h2>III. Expert Systems and Revival (1970s-1980s)</h2>
            
            <p>Facing the困境 of general AI, researchers turned to more practical professional applications, opening a new chapter in AI development.</p>
            
            <h3>1. Rise of Expert Systems</h3>
            
            <p>Expert systems are rule-based AI programs that solve problems in specific domains by encoding human expert knowledge. Representative systems included:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>DENDRAL (1965)</strong>: Chemical analysis system developed by Stanford University</li>
                <li><strong>MYCIN (1976)</strong>: Medical expert system for diagnosing blood infections</li>
                <li><strong>XCON (1980)</strong>: Commercial expert system used by DEC for configuring computer systems, saving the company tens of millions of dollars annually</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The success of expert systems moved AI research from academic laboratories to commercial applications, and also prompted Japan to launch the "Fifth Generation Computer" project in 1982, investing $850 million to develop AI-driven computer systems.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Revival of Connectionism</h3>
            
            <p>Although neural network research was in a trough during the 1970s, key breakthroughs were brewing:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Backpropagation algorithm</strong>: First proposed by Paul Werbos in his 1974 doctoral dissertation, but not widely recognized until 1986</li>
                <li><strong>Hopfield network (1982)</strong>: Recurrent neural network invented by John Hopfield</li>
                <li><strong>Boltzmann machine (1985)</strong>: Stochastic neural network proposed by Terrence Sejnowski and Geoffrey Hinton</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>In 1986, David Rumelhart and Geoffrey Hinton successfully applied the backpropagation algorithm to train multilayer perceptrons, solving nonlinear classification problems and planting the seeds for the deep learning revolution.</p>
            
            <h2>IV. Statistical Learning and Internet Era (1990s-2000s)</h2>
            
            <p>With the improvement of computer performance and the popularization of the Internet, AI research entered a new phase dominated by data-driven approaches.</p>
            
            <h3>1. From Symbolism to Statistical Learning</h3>
            
            <p>The distinctive features of this period were:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Machine learning replaced rule-based expert systems as the mainstream</li>
                <li>Statistical methods such as probabilistic graphical models (e.g., Bayesian networks) and support vector machines (SVM) made breakthroughs</li>
                <li>The Internet provided unprecedented massive data</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>In 1997, IBM's "Deep Blue" supercomputer defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov, demonstrating the power of combining brute force search with expert knowledge.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Algorithm Innovation and Theoretical Breakthroughs</h3>
            
            <p>Important algorithmic advances during this period included:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN, 1989)</strong>: Yann LeCun applied CNN to handwritten digit recognition</li>
                <li><strong>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM, 1997)</strong>: Proposed by Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber, solving the long-term dependency problem of RNN</li>
                <li><strong>AdaBoost (1995)</strong>: Ensemble learning method proposed by Yoav Freund and Robert Schapire</li>
                <li><strong>Random Forest (2001)</strong>: Another ensemble learning method proposed by Leo Breiman</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>V. Deep Learning Revolution (2010s)</h2>
            
            <p>In the second decade of the 21st century, driven by data, computing power, and algorithms, AI迎来了 the explosive "Deep Learning Revolution".</p>
