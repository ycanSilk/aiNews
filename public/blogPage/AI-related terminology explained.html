            <h2>1. Basic Theory Layer: The Foundation of AI</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Machine Learning</strong> is a methodology that enables computers to learn patterns from data, similar to teaching children through examples rather than memorizing rules. It is the core foundation of AI, allowing systems to automatically improve performance.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Deep Learning</strong> is a machine learning method based on multi-layer neural networks, mimicking the hierarchical processing of the human brain. It extracts increasingly abstract features from data through multiple layers of transformation.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Neural Networks</strong> are computational models that mimic the connections of neurons in the human brain, consisting of numerous interconnected "neurons" where each neuron receives input, processes it, and produces output.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Transformer</strong> is a neural network architecture based on self-attention mechanism, proposed by Google in 2017, and has become the mainstream architecture for natural language processing. Its core advantage is the ability to process sequence data in parallel and capture long-range dependencies.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Model Architecture Layer: The Core Engine of AI</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Large Models</strong> refer to deep learning models with enormous parameter counts, typically containing over 1 billion parameters. These models are trained on massive datasets and can handle various complex tasks, with more parameters generally indicating stronger capabilities.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Large Language Models (LLM)</strong> are large models specifically designed for processing natural language, such as the GPT series. They can generate fluent text, translate languages, answer questions, and are the core of modern AI applications.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Mixture of Experts (MOE)</strong> is an architecture that divides large models into multiple expert sub-networks. Each expert specializes in a specific domain, and the system dynamically selects the most relevant expert based on input, maintaining capability while improving efficiency.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Parameter Scale</strong> refers to the number of adjustable weights in a model, which is a key factor determining model capability. More parameters generally mean stronger expressive power but also require more computational resources.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Data Processing Layer: The Information Pipeline of AI</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Token</strong> is the basic unit of text processing, typically 2-3 Chinese characters form one Token. It is the smallest building block for AI language processing.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Tokenization</strong> is the process of splitting text into token sequences, which is the first step in text processing. Different models may use different tokenization strategies.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Context Length</strong> determines the number of tokens a model can process at once, equivalent to AI's "short-term memory capacity". Longer context allows processing longer documents or conversations.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Quantization</strong> is a technique that reduces computational resource consumption by lowering model parameter precision, such as converting from 32-bit floating-point to 8-bit integers, making models lighter while maintaining reasonable performance.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Distillation</strong> is a technique that enables small models to learn knowledge from large models, "transferring" the capabilities of large models to small models through training processes, achieving knowledge transfer.</p>
            
            <h2>4. Application Technology Layer: Practical Tools of AI</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Prompt Engineering</strong> is the technique of designing input prompts to obtain better outputs, similar to learning the "language art" of communicating with AI. Good prompts can significantly improve model output quality.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> is a method that combines external knowledge bases to improve answer accuracy. The model retrieves relevant information before generating answers, ensuring responses are based on the latest and most accurate knowledge.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Fine-tuning</strong> is the process of domain adaptation training on pre-trained models, making general models suitable for specific tasks or domains, similar to turning a generalist into a specialist.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Multimodal</strong> refers to the ability to simultaneously process multiple types of data (text, images, audio, etc.), enabling AI to understand the world through multiple senses like humans.</p>
            
            <h2>5. System Intelligence Layer: The Complete Form of AI</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Agent</strong> is a complete system capable of perceiving the environment, making decisions, and executing actions. An agent typically includes three core modules: perception, planning, and action.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Embodied Intelligence</strong> emphasizes the combination of AI with physical bodies, learning through interaction with the environment. This enables AI to not only operate in the digital world but also act in the physical world.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong> is a method of training AI through reward mechanisms, where AI learns through trial and error, with good behaviors rewarded and bad behaviors punished, similar to training pets.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Generative AI</strong> refers to AI systems capable of creating new content (text, images, music, etc.), different from traditional AI that only classifies or predicts, it is more like a "creator".</p>
            
            <h2>6. Optimization and Deployment Layer: Engineering Practices of AI</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Model Compression</strong> is a general term for various techniques that reduce model size and computational requirements, including quantization, pruning, etc., making AI models easier to deploy in resource-constrained environments.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Inference Optimization</strong> refers to methods that improve model runtime efficiency, focusing on how to make trained models run faster and more resource-efficiently in practical applications.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Alignment</strong> is a research field that ensures AI system goals align with human values, addressing the "more capable, more dangerous" problem, making AI not only powerful but also safe.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Deployment Architecture</strong> is the system design for applying AI models to real-world environments, including engineering considerations such as serviceization, monitoring, and scaling.</p>
            
            <h2>7. Frontier Research Directions: Future Exploration of AI</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Emergent Capabilities</strong> are abilities that suddenly appear when model scale reaches a certain level, which smaller models do not possess, demonstrating the fascinating phenomenon of quantitative change leading to qualitative change.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Self-Supervised Learning</strong> is a learning method that does not require human-annotated data, where models learn representations from the structure of data itself, reducing dependence on expensive annotated data.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Federated Learning</strong> is a distributed data privacy-preserving learning framework that allows multiple devices to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, protecting user privacy.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Explainable AI</strong> is a technology that makes AI decision processes more transparent and understandable, solving the "black box" problem and helping humans understand and trust AI decisions.</p>
            
            <h2>Learning Path Recommendations</h2>
            
            <p>For beginners, it is recommended to learn in the following order:</p>
