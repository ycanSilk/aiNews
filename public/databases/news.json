    "slug": "deepseek-ai-agent-model-2025",
    "content": "According to informed sources, Hangzhou-based AI startup DeepSeek is intensively developing an artificial intelligence model with advanced agent capabilities, aiming to compete head-to-head with US tech giants like OpenAI in the cutting-edge field of AI agents. Sources indicate that the new AI model being built by DeepSeek possesses powerful autonomous execution capabilities, enabling it to perform complex multi-step operations on behalf of users with minimal instructions. More importantly, the system also has learning capabilities, allowing it to self-optimize and improve based on previous operational experience. It is understood that DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng is personally supervising the R&D work and has requested the team to officially launch this breakthrough software product in the fourth quarter of this year. This timeline demonstrates the company's urgency and ambition in the AI agent technology race. AI agent technology is seen as the next important milestone in artificial intelligence development, enabling AI systems to handle complex tasks more autonomously and reducing the need for human intervention. As of press time, DeepSeek has not responded to this matter.",
